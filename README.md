# 📚 Learn Kotlin - Codecademy

I completed the **Learn Kotlin** course on Codecademy (Free Version - 100% Progress ✅).  
Although it didn’t provide a certificate, I covered all the lessons, quizzes, and projects available in the course.  

This repository contains my notes and code snippets from the course for future reference and practice.
