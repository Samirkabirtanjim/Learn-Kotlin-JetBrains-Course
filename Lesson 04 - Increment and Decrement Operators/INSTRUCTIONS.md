# Lesson 04: Increment and Decrement Operators

## Summary
This lesson introduces Kotlin’s shorthand arithmetic operators — `++` and `--` — for quick addition and subtraction by 1.

## Objective
Use increment and decrement operators to determine the final value of variable `d`.

## Instructions
In `Challenge.kt`, variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are set up with numerical values and expressions. Determine the final value of `d` using:
- `a++` (increments `a` by 1)
- `b--` (decrements `b` by 1)
- `c += 3` (adds 3 to `c`)

Store the value of `d` as a **single-line comment**:
```kotlin
// d: some value
